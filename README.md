# Covid19 status in Italy, daily updated

*In this year together, we have fought, and we keep doing that, a war. It might sound exaggerated, but think it over, about the effects: crisis in every field. Who suffer from it? The economies of the countries. Who suffers most often? The society, the human relation and, more than any other, every single man and woman who faced (and facing), with difficulty, this crisis.*
> 
Let us not be discouraged, however, by the difficulties, **together**, once again in the human history, we will rise. Renewed. **Stronger and united**.
This is the big lesson from this big crisis.

Sorry for this introduction. My project starts precisely from that.
I wrote this that **takes the data** from Italy official dataset (*protezione civile, whom I thank*) and it **renders these in a minimal format**.
 
This is my personal **Christmas Hackathon Project**.
Maybe it isn't impressive, but **this is my really first project in React that I loved**. Not for what the code does, but **for what it communicates**.

Code needs refactoring, I had to write it quickly, but it works.

Wishing you a serene and profitable year, I think we all deserve that.
